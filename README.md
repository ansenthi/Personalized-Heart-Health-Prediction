# Personalized-Heart-Health-Prediction

## Project Overview
This capstone project applies machine learning models to predict personalized health interventions based on physiological, behavioral, and demographic data.

## Key Features
-  Feature Engineering**: BMI Categories, Risk Scores  
-  Model Training**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree  
-  Feature Importance: Identifying key health factors  
-  CA Analysis: Reducing dimensionality for better performance  

## Data Used
- Personalized Diet Recommendations (dietary habits, BMI, recommended meal plans)  
- Heart Health Dataset (blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart history)  
- Diabetes Prediction Dataset (hypertension, glucose, and diabetes indicators)  

## Results
- Best Model: Random Forest with 89% accuracy  
- Key Features:  
  - Blood Pressure Systolic & Diastolic - Major factors influencing health intervention success  
  - Cholesterol Level - High correlation with heart disease predictions  
  - BMI & Exercise Frequency - Contributing significantly to risk assessment
